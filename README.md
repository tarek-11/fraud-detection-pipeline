# üö® Real-Time & Batch Fraud Detection Pipeline

This project implements a scalable data pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions in real-time and analyze fraud trends using batch processing. It leverages Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Airflow, Hadoop HDFS, and Trino to provide both instant fraud alerts and deep fraud investigations.

## üîç Overview

Fraud detection requires intelligent systems that not only catch fraud as it happens but also find hidden fraud patterns over time. This project simulates real-time transaction data using Kafka, processes it using Spark Streaming with custom fraud detection rules, stores the data in HDFS, and uses Trino and batch jobs (via Airflow + Spark) for historical analysis and reporting.
